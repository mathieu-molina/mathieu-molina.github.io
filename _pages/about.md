I am a PhD student at Inria FAIRPLAY â€” CREST ENSAE, under the supervision of Patrick Loiseau, Vianney Perchet, and Nicolas Gast. My research focuses on the impact of fairness on algorithms, and how to be efficient under various fairness requirements.

I am interested in online algorithms such as bandits or prophet inequalities, as well as game theory, auctions in particular.

I graduated from the Mines Paris engineering school, and pursued a master's in Artificial Intelligence, Systems, Data  from PSL University.
