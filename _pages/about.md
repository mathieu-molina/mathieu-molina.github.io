I am now a post-doc with Michal Feldman at Tel Aviv University.

I am interested in online algorithms such as bandits or prophet inequalities, fairness, and game theory, auctions in particular.

I was a PhD student at Inria FAIRPLAY — CREST ENSAE, under the supervision of the amazing Patrick Loiseau, Vianney Perchet, and Nicolas Gast! My research focused on the impact of fairness on algorithms, and how to be efficient under various fairness requirements.

I graduated from the Mines Paris engineering school, and pursued a master's in Artificial Intelligence, Systems, Data  from PSL University.
